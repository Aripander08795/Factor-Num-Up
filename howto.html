	<b>Factors</b>
	<br>
	Factors increase the production of number multiplicatively and can be stacked. You can increase the factor additively by spending with number. There are a total of 7 factors.<br>
	Every factor has level 1 when you start this game, and each costs 10 times as much as the previous one, starting at 10. Each time you spend some of your number to increase a factor, that factor gains a level, but it also multiplies it's price by 1.5^n (base) where n is the number of the factor. When you increase a factor's level, it adds 1 (base) to that factor.

	<b>Prime</b>
	<br>
	Prime is the currency which you can earn by embracing the power (in this game, this means soft reset). If you embrace the power, only your number and factor levels reset.<br>
	You can spend prime to unlock more features.
	<br><br>
	<b>Upgrades</b>
	<br>
	Upgrades is the first feature. The cost of this feature is free; so don't worry, you don't lose prime when you unlock upgrades!<br>
	To buy an upgrade, you must spend a certain amount of prime. If you do this, the upgrade boosts your production of number or increases one of the 7 factors in various ways, depending on the upgrade.
