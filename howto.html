	<b>Factors</b>
	<br>
	Factors increase the production of number multiplicatively and can be stacked. You can increase the factor additively by spending with number. There are a total of 7 factors.<br>
	Every factor has level 1 when you start this game, and each costs 10 times as much as the previous one, starting at 10. Each time you spend some of your number to increase a factor, that factor gains a level, but it also multiplies it's price by 1.5^n (base) where n is the number of the factor. When you increase a factor's level, it adds 1 (base) to that factor.<br><br>
	You will be able to buy more factor levels with one click by spending prime. This expands further when you spend more prime.
	<br><br>
	<b>Prime</b>
	<br>
	Prime is the currency which you can earn by embracing the power (in this game, this means soft reset). If you embrace the power, only your number and factor levels reset. To embrace the power, your number must be at least 1e11. Prime gain formula: (n/1e11)^0.2 where n is your number.<br>
	You can spend prime to unlock more features.
	<br><br>
	<b>Upgrades</b>
	<br>
	Upgrades are the first feature. The cost of this feature is free; so don't worry, you don't lose prime when you unlock upgrades!<br>
	To buy an upgrade, you must spend a certain amount of prime. If you do this, the upgrade boosts your production of number or increases one of the 7 factors in various ways, depending on the upgrade.
	<br><br>
	<b>Boosts</b>
	<br>
	Boosts are the third feature that comes after "Buy Quantity" feature. You can spend prime to buy fuel, which you can use to  change the boost level. Your first fuel is free, and each one after that costs more than the previous one. You unlock more boosts as you gain more fuel.<br>
