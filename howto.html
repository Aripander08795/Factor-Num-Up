	<b>Factors</b>
	<br>
	Factors can increase the production of number multiplicatively and can be stacked. You can increase the factor additively by spending with number.<br>
	Every factor have level 1 when you start this game. Each time you spend with number to increase factor, it gains a level.

	<b>Prime</b>
	<br>
	Prime is the currency which you can earn by embracing the power (in this game, this means soft reset). If you embrace the power, only number and factors resets.<br>
	You can spend with these to unlock more features.

	<b>Upgrades</b>
	<br>
	Upgrades is a first feature. The cost of this feature is free; so don't worry, you don't lose prime to unlock upgrades!<br>
	If you spent with prime to buy an upgrade, that upgrade boosts your production of number or increases one of 7 factors.
